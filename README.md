## 🚀 Overview
This project aims to improve customer retention and acquisition through data analytics and machine learning. It uses real transaction data to: 
- Segment customers using RFM analysis
- Predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Analyse campaign performance
- Forecast future revenue using time series models
- Build dashboards for data-driven insights

----



## ✨ Features
- 🔄 RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- 📈 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – Historical & Predictive
- 💼 SME vs. Retail vs. Vehicle Segment Comparison
- 🧩 K-Means Clustering for Segmentation
- 📉 Revenue Forecasting (Holt-Winters, SARIMA)
- 🧪 Promotion Effectiveness & Campaign Analysis
- 📊 Cohort Retention & Churn Analysis
- 🔍 Anomaly Detection using Z-scores
- 📊 Interactive Dashboards using Plotly and Power BI

## 🧠 How the Code Works
- Data Cleaning: Remove nulls, duplicates, unify formats
- RFM Analysis: Calculate RFM scores and segments
- CLV Modelling: Calculate CLV by customer, region, and vehicle type
- Clustering: K-Means to group customers
- Cohort Analysis: Identify churn/retention trends
- Campaign Performance: Join & group by campaigns
- Revenue Forecasting: Holt-Winters + SARIMA
- Visualisation: Interactive Plotly Dashboards



---



## 📊 Key Insights
- 💡 Champions and Loyal Customers generate the most revenue.
- 📉 At-risk customers need targeted retention efforts.
- 📈 CLV analysis shows SME and 2W segments are most valuable.
- 📦 Promotions and campaigns vary significantly in effectiveness.
- 🔮 Forecasting reveals seasonal revenue trends for better planning.
